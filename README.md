# Ironhack-Module-2-Project-tableau-Julia-Roch

This project is an analysis of Starbucks' stores over the world. There are three main analysis done, the first one wich countries have the largest amount of Starbucks' stores (after North America), and how these stores are distributed in every country. The second one which are these countries and if they have a coffee culture. Finally the third one, which type of store ownership is the most used in each country and possible reasons why.

This project was done to explore Tableau and put in practice the classes we received during the week. My database was downloaded from kaggle, also I did some web scrapping to enrich the database.
Additionally, I had o clean the data in order to standardize the information.

This is database: https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/store-locations

### :running: **One-liner**
The dataset was enriched with pandas, downloaded and loaded as the database to work with in Tableau, finaly the results were published in Tableau public

### :computer: **Technology stack**
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Tableau

### :boom: **Core technical concepts and inspiration**
The inspiration came from the dataset from Kaggle, I wanted to explore the business of Starbucks and how it became so popular, in my opinion they sell an experience and do not focus on being only a good quality coffee-store, but instead being a comfortable place where you can spend the afternoon.

### :shit: **ToDo**
Next steps: the idea for enriching the dataset was to obtain the business centre locations from some of the cities in the dataset, to compare if the starbucks locations where near business centres and thus proving if Starbucks is targeting working/business people or not.
