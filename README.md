# Ironhack-Module-2-Project-tableau-Julia-Roch

This project is an analysis of Starbucks' stores over the world. There are three main analysis done, the first one wich countries have the largest amount of Starbucks' stores (after North America), and how these stores are distributed in every country. The second one which are these countries and if they have a coffee culture. Finally the third one, which type of store ownership is the most used in each country and possible reasons why.

This project was done to explore Tableau and put in practice the classes we received during the week. My database was downloaded from kaggle, also I did some web scrapping to enrich the database.
Additionally, I had o clean the data in order to standardize the information.
